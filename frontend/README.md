# News App Frontend

This is the frontend app for the test project by Faran Ali for [Innoscripta](https://www.innoscripta.com)
This project is built in React using Vite as the build tool
To run this project, follow these commands:

open a terminal in the `frontend` directory


run `docker compose up --build --no-recreate -d`

(For older docker version, try `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`)

This will create and start the docker container and start the frontend app which can be accessed at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

This frontend app works with the Laravel backend app located in the `backend` directory
